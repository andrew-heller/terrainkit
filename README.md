# terrainkit
utility for generating game maps


## Notes
- Drop-Zones + Objectives are linked or pre-defined
  - drop-zone options, top-bottom-full, diagonal corner, top-bottom-half 
  - objective-points: how many?
- Game type
- secondary missions

## what we're doing
- adding terrain objects to these maps


### Example
- drop-zone at 

- map builder : https://hextml.playest.net

## Assumptiongs
- dropzones are predefined
- objectives locations are predefined
- criteria for builder
  - favor ranged
  - favor meleee
  - balanced

## good maps have?
- limit direct line of sight between deployment-zones (ie. can't directly shoot the enemy from start)
- encourage movement around map vs direct charge to enemy
- straight-line movement to enemy deployment zone is minimized (ie. if direct line from deployment zone limit it's width)
- larger/easy access paths through map are not straight lines 
- objects and defensive cover, not all protected equally  (1 good, 1 less good, 1 with none)
- map "style", is a map that favors a terrain type, or could it favor a character type? (ranged, melee, vehicle etc.)
  - melee = more cover/line-of-sight
  - ranged = less cover/more-line-of-sight
- line-of-sight, vs line-of-movement? 
  

## how to create this
- place drop-zones
- divide map into sub-squares (6x6?)
- draw direct lines between zones/ or zone objectives
- based around objectes.

# 5 Map-Cards
--always 5 objectives
--

## 3 zone maps
- zones: 3
- dropzone-locations: 1-0-1
- objective-locations:  1-3-1
- 4 square, circle in center (diagnol squares)
- verital (landscape map - long-side zones)
- horizontal (portrait mapd short side zones, default)
- horizontal-diag (portait map)

-objectives are measured from center of table
- always one in center
- equidistant from deployment zones and center of map
- focus on no-mans-land for layout, deployment zones can stretch

-nomans land - 12" from center of map, 20" to delpoyment objective
- 16" on mid-line for remaining 2 objectives.
